				<h2>How Much of Your Fantasy Football Draft is Predetermined by League Projections?</h2>
				<p><b>BENN STANCIL</b></p>
				<img src="http://static.tvgcdn.net/MediaBin/Galleries/Shows/G_L/La_Lh/League_The/season3/the-league-45.jpg">
				<p>Two weeks ago, we kicked off our fantasy season with a player draft. ESPN’s draft center provides fantasy owners with an overwhelming amount of information on each player, but time and again, only one data point seemed to matter: how many points ESPN projected that player would score. Pick after pick, teams would choose the best available player at each position. By the end of the draft, we were all wondering the same thing: <b>How much do these projections affect draft results?</b>></p>
				<p>Most leagues follow this pattern, in which fantasy owners tend to adhere to the player rankings provided by the league. While teams rarely select the highest point scorer available - kickers, for instance, tend to get drafted much later than running backs, regardless of their projected output - teams typically follow to point projections <b>by position</b>. In other words, the draft order of wide receivers is nearly identical to the point projection ranking for wide receivers.</p>

				<p>Nobody knows what to make of Jonathan Dwyer’s up-and-down preseason</p>
				<p>This relationship doesn’t necessarily imply that teams are drafting mechanically according to ESPN’s recommendations. People want to draft the best players, so it makes sense for there to be close relationship between draft orders and the consensus on who’s best. ESPN’s “expert” advice could determine our opinions on players, or it could simply reflect what we already know.</p>
				<p>Fortunately, there are other cases in which that advice is different. CBS, which manages another widely used fantasy football platform, provides their own projections for their leagues. By comparing the differences in CBS and ESPN point projections to the differences in average draft positions, we can estimate how much drafts are affected by these projections.</p>
				<p>As it turns out, we just do what we’re told. (Except Rage Against the Machine. They won’t do what we tell them.) Differences in ESPN and CBS rankings by position strongly correlate with differences in ESPN and CBS draft outcomes. According to rough calculations, approximately 35% of the variation in CBS’s and ESPN’s draft results can be explained by differences in how each league projects players will perform.</p>
				<p>The relationship is even stronger if you eliminate the later rounds, which are mostly made of up of teams drafting backups and bench players. For players drafted in the first 10 rounds, differences in projections explain 70% of the differences in draft results. Ranking a player one spot lower within their position (e.g., projecting a running back to score the 10th most points instead of 9th) lowers that players average draft position by about two picks.</p>
